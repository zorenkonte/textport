# Textport

A tiny, native Android app that reads the **SMS messages stored on your device**
and exports them to a file you save yourself. It's a personal backup tool meant
to be **sideloaded** — see the [Google Play caveat](#google-play-caveat) below.

Textport never uploads anything. Messages are read from the system SMS provider,
formatted on-device, and written to a location **you** pick via the Android file
picker. There is no network code.

## Features

- Read both **SMS** (`Telephony.Sms`) and **MMS** (`Telephony.Mms`, including
  each message's text parts and addresses) with the `READ_SMS` runtime
  permission, off the main thread. Every SMS box is read — inbox, sent, draft,
  outbox, and importantly **failed / queued** — and MMS is included because a
  text that fails to a number that can't receive it is frequently stored as an
  MMS in the outbox, not as an SMS. Reading MMS needs only `READ_SMS`; Textport
  never has to be your default SMS app.
- **Grouped by conversation**, like a messaging app: the main screen lists
  threads (contact/number, latest message, message count, and an "unsent" badge
  when a thread contains failed/queued/outbox messages). Tap a conversation to
  see it as chat bubbles, with unsent messages clearly marked.
- The load status shows a per-type breakdown (e.g. `received 300, sent 38,
  failed 4`) so you can confirm the unsent messages were captured.
- Export to **JSON**, **CSV**, or **HTML**:
  - **JSON** — an object with `exported_at`, `count`, and a `messages` array;
    ISO-8601 timestamps. Each message carries a `kind` of `sms` or `mms`.
  - **CSV** — RFC-4180 quoting, header row, a `kind` column, `body` column last.
  - **HTML** — a single self-contained, chat-style page grouped by thread,
    with light/dark support via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Export **everything** or a **single conversation** (from that conversation's
  screen). Saves through the Storage Access Framework, so **no storage
  permission** is needed and you choose the destination. Suggested filenames:
  `textport-YYYY-MM-DD.<ext>` or `textport-<contact>-YYYY-MM-DD.<ext>`.

## Tech stack

- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3
- MVVM: `ViewModel` + `StateFlow`, Kotlin coroutines
- Gradle Kotlin DSL with a version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 35, `minSdk` 26, JDK 17

## Build & install

The Gradle wrapper is committed, so a JDK 17 and the Android SDK are all you need.

```bash
# Debug build (auto-signed with the Android debug key, directly installable)
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Run the unit tests (export formatters)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Unsigned release build
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

You can also open the project in Android Studio and Run it on a device or
emulator.

### Prebuilt APKs (GitHub Actions)

The [`Release APK`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow builds a signed,
installable APK. There are two ways to cut a release:

- **From the Actions tab:** run the *Release APK* workflow manually and enter a
  `version` (e.g. `v1.0`). The workflow builds, signs, **creates the tag**, and
  publishes it as a GitHub Release — no local tag push needed. Leave `version`
  blank to just build the APK and download it as a run artifact.
- **By pushing a tag:** `git tag v1.0 && git push --tags` triggers the same
  build-sign-publish flow.

By default the workflow signs with a fresh self-signed key each run — installable,
but you must uninstall a previous build before installing a newer one. To sign
with a stable key (so releases upgrade in place), set these repository secrets:
`KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64 of your `.jks`), `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`,
`KEY_PASSWORD`.

### Granting the permission

On first load, Textport requests the `READ_SMS` permission. If you deny it (or
disable it later in **Settings → Apps → Textport → Permissions**), the app shows
a clear message and reads nothing. Grant it and tap **Load messages** again.

## Scope

**SMS and MMS.** Textport reads text messages from both the SMS and MMS
providers — including failed, queued, outbox and draft messages, and the
**text** of MMS messages (the common landing spot for a text that failed to
send). It does **not** read:

- **MMS media** — only the text parts are exported, not attached images/audio.
- **RCS** (Google Messages "chat features") — not exposed to third-party apps.
  If RCS is on, an unsent message you typed may be held in the messaging app's
  private RCS store rather than the SMS/MMS providers, in which case no
  third-party app (including Textport) can read it. A message that failed to
  send over SMS/MMS lands in the telephony providers and is captured.
- **iMessage / other chat apps** — not on Android.

**iOS is intentionally out of scope:** Apple provides no API for apps to read the
Messages store, so an equivalent iOS app isn't possible.

## Google Play caveat

Google Play restricts the `READ_SMS` permission to apps that are the device's
**default SMS handler**. Textport is a read-only backup utility, not an SMS app,
so it is **not intended for Play distribution** — install it by sideloading the
APK (see [Build & install](#build--install)).
